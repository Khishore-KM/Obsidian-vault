##### What are we trying to achieve in CTS:
- Clock has more load and power critical.
- Clock skew balancing.
- Minimize clock latency.
- Balancing load across different blocks.
- Reducing power consumption.
- Reducing crosstalk.
- Reducing electro-migration.

*Most commonly used clock tree building is done using H tree*
