SVT - Standard Variant.
HVT - Higher Variant.
LVT - Lower Variant.

##### Delay:
LVT < SVT < HVT

LVT -> Lower threshold Voltage.(Hence Faster Switching -> Lesser Delay -> High Leakage Current) 

HVT -> Higher Threshold Voltage.(Slower Switching -> Higher Delay -> Lesser Leakage Current)

*SVT is mostly used in most of the cases*

*LVT is used for timing fixes in high frequency design(Should not overuse it)*

*HVT is used for Hold fixes.*

##### Area:
All the three cells have equal area.
No footprint changes only the doping concentration changes.

##### Doping Concentration: 
LVT < SVT < HVT.
