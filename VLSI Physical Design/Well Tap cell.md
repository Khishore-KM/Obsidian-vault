*Well Tap Cells are used to prevent the latch-up issue in CMOS design. Well Tap cells connect the nwell to VDD and p-substrate to VSS in order to prevent the latch up issue.
There is no logical function in well tap cell rather than proving a taping in nwell and p-substrate therefore well tap cell is known as physical only cell*

##### Connections in Well Tap cell:
- Nwell to VDD.
- P-substrate to VSS.
