The first operational amplifier is named as IC-709 and it is manufactured by Fairchild semiconductors and the present IC-741 is also manufactured by the same company
Some technical aspect is as expected it requires external power supply for functioning 
as like the normal transistors.

Ideal parameters of op-amp:
						the ideal op amp senses the difference between the input signal and amplifies it 
to produce the output signal.
Ideal op amp draws no current at both the input terminals thus its input impedance is infinite.
Any source can drive it as there is no driving effect on the driver side.
						Infinite voltage gain , it is basically open loop gain.
						Infinite input impedance.
						Zero output impedance.
						Zero offset voltage.
						Infinite bandwidth.
						Infinite CMRR.
						Infinite slew rate.
