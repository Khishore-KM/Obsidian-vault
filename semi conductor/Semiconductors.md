Semiconductors also called as small band gap  insulators the electronic properties of semiconductor materials can be altered by doping it with impurities. Basically all the things fall under thee band gap condition the energy required to fill the gap of Si is 0.3V like wise this is the reson for calling them band insulators. They form the building blocks of chips , diodes, transistors and its further applications are gained by us like switching , rectification , amplification etc.

Semiconductors also fall under two types:
                    *Single Crystal*  (Si , Ge)
					*Compound Crystal* (GaAs - Gallium Arsenide , Gallium Nitride etc.)

Semiconductor elements: Gallium , Indium , Silicon , Germanium , Arsenic , Antimony are the major semi conductors which are being used.

Band Gap: It is the gap between valence band of an element to conduction band so that that more electrons can move from valence band to conduction band which enables better consumption.

Temperature properties of semiconductors:
                       Unlike conductors in which the resistance of the material increases upon increasing the temperature of the metal,
					   
					   Why this is happening?
					              When a conductor is heated the electrons in it is heated and tend to vibrate this will lead to reduction inflow of electrons.
					   
					This phenomenon is called Positive Temperature coefficient.
					   
	
	
Semiconductors have opposite properties as that of conductors when we increase the temperature of a semiconductor the resistance of the material increases
					   why it is happening? 
					   when we increase the temperature the valence band electrons in the semiconductors will gain enough energy to pass the band gap present between valence band and the conduction band.
					   
					   This phenomenon is called negative Temperature coefficient.
