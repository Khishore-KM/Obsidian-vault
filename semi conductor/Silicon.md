The valence band of the of the silicon is ns2 np2 which has four electrons in the valence band which gives it a chance to combine with other elements forming [[p-type]] , [[n-type]] semiconductors . The knee voltage of silicon is 0.7V to make the electrons of move from valence band to conduction band. 

*Everyone would have a doubt right there are many semiconductor elements then why we are going only for silicon than other elements is let us consider Silicon and germanium , Germanium cannot be subjected to temperatures greater than that of 70 C after this temperature Gemanium loose its structure and cannot be used for manufacturing whereas when we take silicon it will not loose its structure even at 150 degrees making it an usable  one and also the leakage current of Silicon is very low when compared to that of Germanium so silicon is the most preferrrable *

Leakage current:
                  Leakage current is the current that flows from either AC or DC circuit in equipment to the chassis, or to the ground, and can be either from the input or the output. If the equipment is not properly grounded, the current flow through other paths such as the human body. This may also happen if the ground is inefficient or is interrupted intentionally or unintentionally. This leakage current is the reason why we get some shock when we touch the edges of laptops and computers so the leakage current should be very low for a device to work on with.
