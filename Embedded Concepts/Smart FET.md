#### Features of Smart FET:
Smart FETs often incorporate built-in protection circuits to safeguard the transistor from overvoltage, overcurrent and overheating conditions. These protection features help improve the reliability and durability of the device.

Smart FETs includes diagnostic circuitry that enables the monitoring of various parameters such as temperature , current, voltage and fault conditions.
These information is used for system health monitoring, fault detection and trouble shooting.

Some smart FETS also incorporate on-chip logic and control circuitry, allowing them to operate autonomously or respond to specific input conditions.

Smart FETs may feature communication interfaces like SPI , I2C etc. Smart FETs also include design optimizations efficiency, power handling capabilities, switching speed 
other performance metrics.

### The below diagram is an example Smart FET:

These performance metrics will be altered for different manufacturers.
