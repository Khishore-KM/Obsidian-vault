Backward diode is similar to that of tunnel diode and zener diode 

The backward diode is used in a reverse biased mode.
The negative resistance region is selected and is utilized for the 
operation of the diode.



The backward diode is used as a detector upto 40GHz . The capacitance of the diode is 
low hence charge storage is minimized.


PNPN diode:

 It  has two layers of p and n layered silicon It resembles a silicon controller rectifier 
 but there is no control or gate input

Point contact Diode:

The point contact diode is basically  a pn junction diode in which 
there will be only one region and the other region is basically a metallic wire connecting the junctions.
The V-I characteristics are similar to that of p-n junction diode .
The most important part this there is will be very low capacitance between the p region and the n region hence the switching time will be much faster when compared to other diode.
Hence it is used for small signal processing 
It is also used for high frequency application due to low capacitance.

PIN DIODE:

It is basically a normal p-n junction diode in which a intrinsic semiconductor layer is added between the p and n region intrinstic mean here is basically pure layer of germanium or silicon

Gunnn Diode:

A gunn diode is a passive semiconductor device with two terminals which composed of only an n doped semiconductor material unlike other diodes which consists of a pn junction.
